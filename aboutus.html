        <p>Founded in 2018 by passionate horticulturist Jamie Rivers, BrightSprout Landscaping was born from a
            vision: to create outdoor spaces that are not only stunning but also environmentally responsible.
            What started as a small design studio in Missouri has grown into a dedicated team of landscaping
            professionals, each bringing unique skills and creativity to every project. <br>
            <br>
            At BrightSprout, we believe that a landscape should do more than just look beautiful—it should work
            in harmony with nature. By combining expert design with sustainable practices, we craft outdoor
            spaces that thrive year-round, support local ecosystems, and reflect the unique character of each
            property. Whether it’s a cozy backyard garden, a sprawling lawn, or a vibrant commercial property,
            our designs are tailored to enhance the beauty and functionality of every space we touch.
